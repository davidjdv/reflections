What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    It creates the Git structures in the .git directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Staging contains files that will be committed - it allows to "group" files logically

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    You only add the files that are relevant to the commit you want to make
    
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

    Branches track "variants"... at the very least, one can be "stable" and another can be for developing new features
