How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helps spot small differences like typos - and it's invaluable for big files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Very: it's a huge plus to be able to follow how any file evolved

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: greater control - don't do it for trivial changes + meta-data
	Cons: what if you forget to do it ? Or something bad happens before you get a chance ?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Programs tend to have multiple files working together.
	Documents tend to live in a single file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: find the different commits + logs
	git diff: see exactly what changed between 2 commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always fallback...

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Everything ? ;-)
