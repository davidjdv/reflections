When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you want to share with others and also has a form of centralized backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Multiple people could be working on the same remote repository and you want to have control over what gets pulled/merged
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Fork: copy someone else's repository on GitHub to maintain your own version (it's a server-side clone)
    Clone: copy a remote repository locally
    Branch: create a new set set of files that diverges (and isolates) from the mainline
